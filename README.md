## 🎮 How to Play

### Objective
Clear all cells on the grid without detonating any mines!

### Controls
- **Left Click**: Reveal a cell
- **Right Click**: Toggle flag on a cell
- **Double Click**: Add question mark

### Rules
1. Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell
2. Use flags to mark cells you think contain mines
3. Clear all non-mine cells to win
4. Hit a mine and you lose!

### Tips
- Start from corners or edges
- Use the number patterns to deduce mine locations
- Flag all certain mines before revealing risky cells
- The first click is always safe
